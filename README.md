# Multiserver-Performance-Monitoring-Tool-
In this tool we evaluate the performance of web servers and the network elements that provide the servers with internet access. Performance metrics like CPU usage requests/s, transferred bytes/s and number of bytes/request for web server. And bit/s per interface difference between in and out as well as aggregated bit rate over all interfaces.  The aim is to build a tool that allows us to correlate performance metrics from both the network and the application. The tool should allow a visual comparison between server and link layer performance metrics. The tool also have the functionality of add/remove devices to monitor. The user will be able to select what metric and device that he wants to compare. The Tool has a simple web Gui that allows the user to interact with the Tool.
